# Linear Algebra Learning Games

A collection of interactive games designed to help learn and practice linear algebra concepts.

## Games

### 1. Vector Voyage

A space navigation game that teaches vector operations in a visual, interactive way.

**Concepts covered:**
- Vector addition and subtraction
- Scalar multiplication
- Linear combinations
- Coordinate systems
- Vector visualization

**How to play:**
1. Navigate to the `/vector_voyage` directory
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Use the control panel to set vector components and apply operations
4. Complete missions by reaching the target coordinates using vector operations

## How to Run

Simply open the HTML file for any game in a web browser. No server or installation required.

```
cd linear_algebra_games/vector_voyage
open index.html  # On macOS
```

## Coming Soon

More games are under development:
- Matrix Mastermind
- Eigenvalue Escape Room
- Linear System Sudoku
- Determinant Detective
- Basis Builder
- Orthogonal Olympics

## Development Roadmap

The following games are currently under development:

### 2. Matrix Mastermind

A puzzle game focused on matrix transformations.

**Concept:** Transform shapes on a grid by applying matrix operations.

**Gameplay:**

* Start with simple shapes on a coordinate grid
* Apply rotation, reflection, scaling, and shearing matrices
* Match the target shape by composing the right sequence of transformations
* Visualize how matrices transform space

### 3. Eigenvalue Escape Room

A puzzle-solving game based on eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

**Concept:** Solve puzzles by finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices.

**Gameplay:**

* Each room contains matrix-based puzzles
* Find the eigenvalues to unlock doors
* Use eigenvectors to determine directions or codes
* Visualize how eigenvectors remain in the same direction after transformation

### 4. Linear System Sudoku

A twist on Sudoku using systems of linear equations.

**Concept:** Fill a grid by solving systems of linear equations.

**Gameplay:**

* Instead of traditional Sudoku rules, cells must satisfy linear equations
* Practice Gaussian elimination and other solving techniques
* Difficulty increases with more complex systems
* Visualize solution spaces

### 5. Determinant Detective

A mystery game where you use determinants to solve cases.

**Concept:** Solve mysteries by calculating determinants to unlock clues.

**Gameplay:**

* Each case requires calculating determinants of different matrices
* Use determinants to find areas, volumes, or check if transformations preserve orientation
* Collect evidence by solving increasingly difficult determinant puzzles
* Visual feedback shows how determinants relate to geometric properties

### 6. Basis Builder

A construction game about building and changing bases.

**Concept:** Build structures using different basis vectors.

**Gameplay:**

* Start with standard basis vectors
* Change to different bases to solve construction challenges
* See how coordinates change when the basis changes
* Practice change-of-basis transformations

### 7. Orthogonal Olympics

A racing game based on orthogonality and projections.

**Concept:** Race through courses using orthogonal projections.

**Gameplay:**

* Navigate by projecting your movement vector onto allowed directions
* Use the Gram-Schmidt process to create orthogonal paths
* Optimize your route using orthogonal decompositions
* Visualize projections in real-time
